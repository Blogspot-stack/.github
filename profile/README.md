## üöÄ Overview

**Blogspot.stack** is a macOS utility designed to help you keep your desktop organized, clean, and distraction-free. If you‚Äôve ever opened your Mac and felt overwhelmed by dozens of scattered icons, screenshots, or downloads, Blogspot.stack provides a smart and visual way to keep order.  

Inspired by macOS‚Äôs own *Stacks* feature, Blogspot.stack expands it with more flexibility, additional grouping rules, and customizable views. With this app, you can group files by type, project, tags, or date ‚Äî so instead of endless clutter, you get neatly arranged stacks that are easy to navigate and quick to access.  

It‚Äôs perfect for creatives, professionals, and students who deal with frequent downloads, temporary files, and screenshots. Rather than wasting time searching for lost items, you can open a stack, expand it, and instantly find what you need.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

Blogspot.stack was designed to address one of the most common pain points for Mac users: **desktop chaos**. Screenshots pile up, downloads get forgotten, and documents become hard to track. While Apple‚Äôs built-in Stacks is helpful, Blogspot.stack takes it further by letting you create rules, custom stacks, and visually enhanced layouts.  

You can build stacks based not only on file type, but also by tags, projects, or smart filters. Imagine keeping all screenshots from the last week in one stack, project files in another, and everything else archived automatically. The app makes this possible with a simple interface that blends seamlessly into macOS.  

The goal is to reduce stress and increase productivity. A tidy workspace means less distraction and more focus on what matters. Whether you‚Äôre working on a professional project, studying, or simply browsing, Blogspot.stack ensures your desktop reflects order and clarity.
